<p>A) This document is VX&rsquo;s International Contract of Carriage. It applies only to travel between points outside the United States of America and points within the United States of America. It states the terms upon which VX offers to transport each passenger on such itineraries. By purchasing a ticket for travel on VX, or by using a ticket purchased for you by someone else, you agree to be bound by each of these terms.</p>

<p>B)&nbsp;<u><strong>Changes in Rules, Fares and Charges</strong></u>&nbsp;&ndash; Except as otherwise provided within specific fare rules, transportation is subject to the rules, fares and charges in effect on the date on which the ticket is issued. For the purpose of this rule, purchase of a prepaid ticket advice (PTA) will constitute purchase and issuance of a ticket, provided that the PTA specifies the passenger&rsquo;s originating flight and date and is purchased in accordance with the reservations and ticketing requirements which apply to the fare. The provisions of this rule apply only to the passenger to whom the ticket was originally issued.</p>

<ol style="list-style-type:none">
	<li>1) Where the ticket has been issued prior to the effective date of a tariff containing an increase in the applicable local or joint fare (whether effected through a change in&nbsp;the fare level, a change in conditions governing the fare, or a cancellation of the fare itself), the increase will not be collected, provided:</li>
	<li>
	<p>a) &nbsp;The originating flight coupon of the ticket was issued for a specific flight at a fare in effect on the date of ticket issuance, determined by the validation on the ticket.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>b) &nbsp;Subsequent to the effective date of any increase in the applicable fare, the originating flight coupon is not voluntarily change in any way.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>c) &nbsp;Flight coupons, other than the originating flight coupon, are not voluntarily changed to reflect a change in carrier/fare basis/origin/ destination/stopover points from those originally shown on the ticket.</p>
	</li>
</ol>

<ol start="2" style="list-style-type:none">
	<li>
	<p>2) &nbsp;Reference to tariffs, pages, rules, items and notes are continuous and include revisions, supplements thereto and reissues thereof.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>3) &nbsp;VX will be responsible for the furnishing of transportation only over its own lines. When any carrier undertakes to issue a ticket, check baggage, or make any other arrangements for transportation over the lines of any other carrier (whether or not such transportation is part of a through service), such carrier will act only as agent for such other carrier and will assume no responsibility for the acts or omissions of such other carrier.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>4) &nbsp;No team member or representative of VX may alter, modify or waive any provision of this tariff without the written authorization of a corporate officer. VX reserves the right to change, delete or add to any terms of the contract at any time without prior notice.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>5) &nbsp;Fares apply for travel only between the points for which they are published. Tickets may not be issued at fare(s) published to and/or from a more distance point(s) than the points being travelled, even when issuance of such tickets would produce a lower fare.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>6) &nbsp;Should any provision in this tariff or in the ticket be determined to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, all other provisions shall nevertheless remain valid, binding and effective.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>7) &nbsp;All tickets must be fully paid within 24 hours of booking or travel will be cancelled with no penalty. VX will not be obligated to honor a previously held fare if the fare is not paid in full within the 24 hour ticketing time limit. Provisions in Rules 60 (Reservations) and 65 (Tickets) apply unless noted to the contrary. If it is noted that &ldquo;seats are limited,&rdquo; VX will limit the number of passengers carried on such fares. In addition, those fares will not necessarily be available on all flights in a specific market. Additional details may be found in Rule 61 (Capacity Limitations). Passengers traveling at fares that require advance reservations and ticketing will be accommodated only on the flight for which they hold a confirmed reservation. If a passenger misses their scheduled flight and they report to the airport within two hours of the flight&rsquo;s departure, they will be permitted to go standby for the next available flight at no additional charge. If the next available flight is fully booked, they may go standby on a &ldquo;roll over&rdquo; status on the next flight. Alternatively, passengers may fly confirmed standby for a service charge as set forth in Rule 135.</p>
	</li>
</ol>

<p>C) VX does not guarantee carriage on any particular type or make of aircraft and reserves the right to provide carriage on the aircraft or air carrier of its choice.</p>

<p>D) Arrival and departure times shown in VX&rsquo;s schedules, timetables, or elsewhere are not guaranteed and may be changed without notice.</p>

<p>E) Fares apply for travel only between the points for which they are published. Tickets may not be issued at fare(s) published to and/or from a more distant point(s) published to and/or from a more distant point(s) than the points being traveled, even when the issuance of such tickets would produce a lower fare. When through or connecting passengers enplane at an intermediate point between the origin and destination shown on their tickets, as may require evidence, such as boarding pass, or use of a preceding flight for the portion of the ticket from point of origin to intermediate point. Absent such evidence, VX may require additional fare collection from the passenger for any different between the fare paid for the ticket from origin to destination and the fare which would apply from the intermediate boarding point to the destination.</p>

<p>F)&nbsp;<u><strong>Overriding Law</strong></u>&nbsp;&ndash; Insofar as any provisions contained or referred to in the ticket or in this tariff may be contrary to mandatory law, government regulations, order or requirements, such provisions shall remain applicable to the extent that it is not over-ridden thereby. The invalidity of any provision shall not affect any other part.&nbsp;</p>

<p id="electronic-surveillance"><strong>RULE 15&nbsp;<u>ELECTRONIC SURVEILLANCE OF PASSENGERS AND BAGGAGE</u></strong></p>

<p>The airport security checkpoint is intended to prevent or deter the carriage of weapons, explosives, incendiaries, or other deadly or dangerous weapons or material by passengers and other persons aboard an aircraft or into the sterile area. Passengers and their baggage are subject to inspection with an electronic detector or other inspection devices with or without the passenger&rsquo;s consent or knowledge.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p id="passengers-with-disabilities"><strong>RULE 20&nbsp;<u>TRANSPORTATION OF PASSENGERS WITH DISABILITIES</u></strong></p>

<p>A)&nbsp;<u><strong>Transportation of Passengers with Disabilities</strong></u></p>

<ol style="list-style-type:none">
	<li>
	<p>1) &nbsp;Wheelchairs &ndash; One onboard wheelchair will be made available on board each aircraft at all times.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>2) &nbsp;Upon request, collapsible Guest wheelchairs will be accepted for up to two Guests and placed inside protective bags and stowed in the belly of the aircraft, on a first- come, first-served basis. (For wheelchairs that have batteries, see notes below). All other assistive devices (i.e., braces, crutches, canes, scooters and walkers) may be carried on board and will not count as a personal item. Canes must be stowed on the floor at the passenger&rsquo;s seat so as not to impede an evacuation.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>3) &nbsp;Wheelchairs and other assistive devices that cannot be accommodated in the cabin or overhead storage bins will be transported as priority checked baggage at no charge to the passenger.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>4) &nbsp;Wheelchairs and other assistive devices will take precedence over other passenger baggage. In the event that other passenger baggage is unable to be transported, such baggage will be transported on the next available flight to the passenger&rsquo;s destination.</p>
	</li>
</ol>

<p>B)&nbsp;<u><strong>Passengers Requiring Safety Assistants</strong></u>&nbsp;&ndash; VX may require an assistant for any passenger if VX determines that an assistant is essential for that person&rsquo;s safety. VX will use the following criteria in assessing whether a passenger requires an assistant:</p>

<ol style="list-style-type:none">
	<li>
	<p>1) &nbsp;Is there a mental disability that makes the passenger unable to comprehend or respond appropriately to safety instructions including the briefing?</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>2) &nbsp;Is there a mobility impairment so severe that the passenger is unable to assist in his or her own evacuation of the aircraft?</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>3) &nbsp;Is there a severe hearing or severe vision impairment such that the passenger cannot establish some means of communication with team members?</p>
	</li>
</ol>

<p>If VX determines that the passenger requires an assistant, but the passenger believes that he/she is capable of traveling without an assistant, VX may require an assistant &ndash; either a VX team member or other assistant selected by VX, or an assistant selected by the passenger. In this situation, VX will not charge for the transportation of the passenger&rsquo;s assistant.</p>

<p>C)&nbsp;<strong><u>Other Equipment</u></strong>&nbsp;&ndash; Incubators and stretchers are not permitted in the aircraft for guests use nor may they be carried on board; however, they may be used per the guest&rsquo;s physician&rsquo;s direction prior to departure and upon arrival at either connecting or destination locations. VX allows certain carry-on respiratory assistive devices as set forth in Rule 50. However, the guest, traveling companion or attendant is responsible for setting up the respiratory assistive devices for use on board the aircraft. The oxygen bottles on board are for use by the crew only in accordance with an aircraft and medical emergencies.</p>

<p>D)&nbsp;<u><strong>Allergies</strong></u>&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;VX recognizes that some passengers are allergic to nuts, and that exposure to nuts can result in dire or even fatal consequences for passengers with the most severe allergies. VX cannot guarantee an environment free of any allergens, including peanuts, peanut dust, peanut oil, or peanut remnants. Passengers with severe allergies should advise VX prior to travel.</p>

<p>E)&nbsp;<strong><u>Battery Operated Wheelchairs</u></strong>&nbsp;&ndash; Battery-operating wheelchairs/mobility aids are permitted on VX aircraft, subject to size constraints of the cargo door. Wheelchairs/mobility aids will not be transported if it exhibits evidence of previous leakage or damage. Batteries are classified as either &ldquo;spillable&rdquo; or &ldquo;non-spillable.&rdquo; As used herein, spillable batteries include those batteries that lack required &ldquo;non-spillable&rdquo; labeling by the manufacturer. VX has a limited number of battery packaging units available at each ticket counter, which are available to passengers on a first-come, first-served basis. All batteries must, upon visual inspection (including removal, if necessary, by a qualified team member), reveal no obvious defects. Non- spillable batteries must be marked by the manufacturer as &ldquo;nonspillable&rdquo; batteries. Batteries&nbsp;lacking non-spillable manufacturer labeling and spillable batteries that cannot remain in an upright position must be removed from the wheelchair/mobility aid. If necessary, a qualified team member will be made available to assist the passenger in removing the battery. The battery must be transported in strong, rigid packaging under the following conditions:</p>

<ol style="list-style-type:none">
	<li>
	<p>1) &nbsp;The packaging must be leak-tight and impervious to battery fluid. An inner liner may be used to satisfy this requirement if there is absorbent material placed inside the liner and the liner has a leak-proof closure;</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>2) &nbsp;The battery must be protected against short circuits, secured upright in packaging, and be packaged with enough compatible absorbent material to completely absorb liquid contents in the event of rupture of the battery; and the packaging must be labeled with a corrosive label, marked to indicate proper orientation, and marked with the words &ldquo;battery, wet, with wheelchair.&rdquo;</p>
	</li>
</ol>

<p>F)&nbsp;<u><strong>Other Conditions</strong></u></p>

<ol style="list-style-type:none">
	<li>
	<p>1) &nbsp;VX will refuse to accept a passenger who is unable to sit in a seat with seatbelt fastened.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>2) &nbsp;Passengers with a disability who, in the event of an emergency, would not be able to perform the necessary safety-related tasks, will not be permitted to occupy seats in designated emergency exit rows, in over-wing emergency exit rows, or where the ventral stair may have to be used as an emergency exit.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>3) &nbsp;VX will accept the determination of a person with a disability as to self-reliance.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>4) &nbsp;VX will provide the following types of assistance to passengers with disabilities upon request:</p>
	</li>
</ol>

<ol style="list-style-type:none">
	<li>
	<p>a) &nbsp;Assistance with registration at the check-in counter;</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>b) &nbsp;Assistance in proceeding to the boarding area;</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>c) &nbsp;Assistance in boarding and deplaning;</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>d) &nbsp;Assistance&nbsp;in stowing and retrieving baggage;</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>e) &nbsp;Assistance in moving to and from an aircraft lavatory;</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>f) &nbsp;Assistance in proceeding to the general public area or, in some cases, to a&nbsp;representative of another operator;</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>g) &nbsp;Transferring a person between a mobility aid and the person&rsquo;s passenger seat;</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>h) &nbsp;Provide limited assistance with meals and inquire periodically during a flight&nbsp;about the person&rsquo;s needs; and</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>i) &nbsp;Brief individual passengers with disabilities and their escorts on emergency&nbsp;procedures and the layout of the cabin.</p>
	</li>
</ol>

<p>5) Reservations should be made at least forty-eight (48) hours in advance of travel, advising the carriers as to the nature of the disability and assistance required, so that arrangements can be made. Notwithstanding the foregoing, VX will accommodate passengers with disabilities who do not make their reservations 48 hours in advance of travel, except where U.S. DOT Regulations (14 C.F.R. Part 382) allow 48 hour notice and VX has chosen to so require, in which case VX will make reasonable efforts to accommodate such passengers.&nbsp;</p>

<p id="limitations"><strong>RULE 25&nbsp;<u>REFUSAL TO TRANSPORT&nbsp;</u><u>&ndash; LIMITATIONS OF CARRIER</u></strong></p>

<p>VX may refuse to provide transportation to any passenger, or to remove any passenger from its aircraft in certain situations, including, but not limited to, the following:</p>

	<p>1) &nbsp;The travel documents of the passenger are not in order;</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>2) &nbsp;For any reason, such passenger&rsquo;s embarkation from, transit through, or entry into&nbsp;any country from, through, or to which such passenger desires transportation would be unlawful.</p>
	</li>
</ol>

<p>D) Any passenger who refuses on request to produce positive identification. VX shall have the right, but not be obligated, to require positive identification of person(s) purchasing ticket(s) and/or presenting a ticket(s) for the purpose of boarding aircraft.</p>

<p>E)&nbsp;<u><strong>Comfort and Safety</strong></u></p>

<ol style="list-style-type:none">
	<li>
	<p>1) &nbsp;Any passenger whose conduct is disorderly, offensive, harassing, abusive or violent,&nbsp;who:</p>

	<ol style="list-style-type:none">

	</li>
	<li>
	<p>4) &nbsp;On the basis of safety and security, or when the transportation of a passenger would violate government regulations.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>5) &nbsp;When such action is necessary or advisable due to weather or other conditions beyond VX&rsquo;s control (including, but without limitation to, acts of God, force majeure, strikes, civil commotions, embargoes, wars, hostilities or similar disturbances), including the need to restrict seating capacity.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>6) &nbsp;Any passenger who, in the sole judgment of VX, previously engaged in conduct intended to defraud VX, including, but not limited to, in the purchase of or claims regarding tickets, baggage and elevate credits.</p>

	</li>
	<li>
	<p>8) &nbsp;Any passenger who is unwilling to comply with seating requirements under the additional seat purchase policy as specified in this contract of carriage.

	</li>
	<li>
	<p>9) &nbsp;Any passenger who requires medical oxygen during flight. Oxygen is a compressed gas and is classified as a restricted article that may not be carried by a passenger(s) aboard aircraft. VX does not provide medical oxygen on any of its aircraft. Oxygen is provided on an emergency basis only. However, passengers may bring aboard approved portable oxygen concentrators which do not contain compressed gasses or other hazardous materials. In enforcing these refusal to transport guidelines, VX will fully comply with applicable regulations for the transport of passengers with disabilities, including but not limited to the following:</p>

	<ol style="list-style-type:none">
		<li>
		<p>a) &nbsp;VX will not limit the number of qualified passengers with disabilities on a flight.</p>

		</li>
		<li>
		<p>c) &nbsp;VX will not refuse to transport a qualified passenger with a disability solely&nbsp;because the disability results in appearance or involuntary behavior that may offend, annoy or inconvenience crew members or other passengers. All passengers are asked to refrain from engaging in any conduct that would authorize VX to refuse transport under these refusal to transport guidelines. The sole recourse of any passenger refused carriage or removed en route for any reason specified in this section shall be recovery of the refund value of the unused portion of his or her ticket as provided in the denied boarding compensation section below. As an express precondition to the issuance of any refund, VX shall not be responsible for damages based on the refusal to transport of any kind whatsoever.</p>
		</li>

	</li>
	<li>
	<p>10) &nbsp;VX reserves the right to require a medical clearance from the medical authorities if travel involves any unusual risk or hazard to the passenger or to other passengers (including, in cases of pregnant passengers&rsquo;; or their unborn children).&nbsp;​</p>
	</li>
</ol>

<p id="ground-transfer-service"><strong>RULE 30&nbsp;<u>GROUND TRANSFER SERVICE</u></strong>&nbsp;-- VX does not maintain, operate or provide ground transfer service between airports or between airports and city centers.</p>

<p id="personal-data"><strong>RULE 32&nbsp;<u>PERSONAL DATA</u></strong>&nbsp;&ndash; The passenger recognizes that personal data has been given to VX for the purposes of making a reservation for carriage, obtaining ancillary services, facilitating immigration and entry requirements, and making available such data to government agencies. For these purposes, the passenger authorizes VX to retain such data and to transmit it to its own offices, other carriers, or the providers of such services, in whatever country they may be located.</p>

<p id="smoke-free"><strong>RULE 35&nbsp;<u>SMOKE FREE SERVICE</u></strong>&nbsp;&ndash; Smoking is not allowed on any VX flights. Safety laws prohibit the tampering with, disabling, or destruction of any smoke detector in an aircraft lavatory.</p>

<p id="taxes"><strong>RULE 40&nbsp;<u>TAXES</u></strong>&nbsp;&ndash; Any tax or other charge imposed by government authority and collectible from a passenger will be in addition to the published fares and charges. This includes, in the case of travel to and from Mexico, a no immigrant fee, or DNI, which applies to all travelers other than diplomats and Mexican nationals traveling with a Mexican passport. Guests who believe they are exempt from the DNI may request a reimbursement by submitting appropriate documentation to: Virgin America Guest Relations, P.O. Box 4271, Burlingame, CA 94011.</p>

<p id="administrative-formalities"><strong>RULE 45&nbsp;<u>ADMINISTRATIVE FORMALITIES&nbsp;</u><u>&ndash; PASSPORTS, VISAS AND TOURIST CARDS</u></strong></p>

<p>A)&nbsp;<u><strong>Compliance with Regulations</strong></u>&nbsp;&ndash; VX asks that passengers determine and comply with all laws, regulations, orders, demands, instructions, or travel requirements of countries to be flown from, into, or over, and with all rules, regulations, and instructions of VX. VX shall not be liable for any aid or information given by any agent or team member of VX to any passenger in connection with obtaining necessary documents or complying with such laws, regulations, orders, demands, requirements, or instructions, whether given orally, in writing, or otherwise, or for the consequences to any passenger resulting from his/her failure to obtain such documents or to comply with such laws, regulations, orders, demands, requirements or instructions.</p>

<p>B)&nbsp;<u><strong>Passports and Visas</strong></u></p>

<ol style="list-style-type:none">
	<li>
	<p>1) &nbsp;Each passenger desiring transportation across any international boundary will be responsible for obtaining all necessary travel documents and for complying with all government travel requirements. The passenger must present all exit, entry and other documents required by the laws, and, unless applicable laws provide otherwise, shall indemnify VX for any loss, damage, or expense suffered or incurred by VX by reason of such passenger&rsquo;s failure to do so. VX is not liable to the passenger for loss or expense due to the passenger&rsquo;s failure to comply with this provision. VX reserves the right to refuse carriage to any passenger who has not complied with applicable laws, regulations, orders, demands, or requirements or whose documents are not complete. VX shall not be liable for any aid or information given by any agent or team member of VX to any passenger in connection with obtaining such documents or complying with such laws, whether given orally or in writing or otherwise.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>2) &nbsp;Subject to applicable laws and regulations, the passenger agrees to pay the applicable fare whenever VX, on government order, is required to return a passenger to his point of origin or elsewhere due to the passenger&rsquo;s inadmissibility into or deportation from a country, whether of transit or of destination. The fare applicable will be the fare that would have been applicable had the original ticket designated the revised destination on the new ticket. Any difference between the fare so applicable and the fare paid by the passenger will be collected from or refunded to the passenger as the case may be. VX may apply to the payment of such fares any funds paid by the passenger to the VX for unused carriage, or any funds of the passenger in the possession of VX. The fare collected for carriage to the point of refusal or deportation will not be refunded by VX, unless the law of such country requires that such fare be refunded.</p>
	</li>
</ol>

<p>C)&nbsp;<u><strong>Customs Inspection</strong></u>&nbsp;&ndash; If required, the passenger must attend inspection of his baggage, checked or unchecked, by Customs or other government officials. VX accepts no responsibility toward the passenger if the latter fails to observe this condition. If damage is caused to VX because of the passenger&rsquo;s failure to observe this condition, the passenger shall indemnify VX therefore. VX shall not be liable to the passenger for any aid, assistance, data, or other information provided to government agencies, including, but not limited to, customs, which are involved in border controls of any country pertaining to passenger or passenger&rsquo;s travel.</p>

<p>D)&nbsp;<u><strong>Government Regulation</strong></u>&nbsp;&ndash; No liability shall be attached to VX if VX, in good faith, determines that what it understands to be applicable law, government regulation, demand, order or requirements, requires that it refuse and it does refuse to carry a passenger.&nbsp;</p>

<p id="preplanned-oxygen-service"><strong>RULE 50&nbsp;<u>PREPLANNED OXYGEN SERVICE</u></strong></p>

	<li>
	<p>2) &nbsp;In the case of unchecked baggage, VX is liable only to the extent the damage resulted from its fault, or that of its servants or agents.</p>

<p id="reservations"><strong>RULE 60&nbsp;<u>RESERVATIONS</u></strong></p>

<p>A)&nbsp;<u><strong>Confirmation of Reserved Space</strong></u></p>

<ol style="list-style-type:none">
	<li>
	<p>1) &nbsp;<u>General</u>&nbsp;&ndash; A ticket will be valid only for flight(s) for which reservation(s) shall have been made, and only between points of origin and destination and via the routing designation thereon.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>2) &nbsp;<u>Confirmation of Space</u>&nbsp;&ndash; A reservation for space on a given flight is valid when the availability and allocation of such space is confirmed in VX&rsquo;s reservation system. Subject to payment or satisfactory credit arrangement, a validated ticket will be issued indicating such confirmed space, unless an earlier advance ticketing deadline is imposed by the applicable fare rule, the reservation must be paid for and ticketed at least sixty (60) minutes before posted departure time. All passengers must be checked in at least forty (40)&nbsp;minutes prior to departure for U.S. domestic flights and sixty (60) minutes for international flights. The only exception are flights departing from Philadelphia (PHL), Denver (DEN) and Las Vegas (LAS), which cutoff check-in forty-five (45) minutes prior to departure. All passengers must be available in the boarding area at least fifteen (15) minutes prior to departure for U.S. domestic flights and thirty (30) minutes for international flights. Recommended check-in times are as follows: ninety (90) minutes for U.S. domestic flight departures and two (2) hours for international flight departures. Because not all passengers holding confirmed reservations usually use those reservations, VX may intentionally confirm a greater number of reservations for a flight than there are seats available in the aircraft. In that event, VX&rsquo;s obligation to the passenger is governed by Rule 87 (Denied Boarding Compensation). A passenger who obtains a ticket that reflects confirmed space on a specific flight and date shall be regarded as having confirmed reserved space even if no other record of the reservation can be found.</p>
	</li>
	<li>3)&nbsp;<u>Seat Allocation</u>&nbsp;&ndash; VX does not guarantee allocation of any particular space in the aircraft.</li>
</ol>

<p>B)&nbsp;<u><strong>Cancellation of Reservations</strong></u></p>

<ol style="list-style-type:none">

If a passenger must change his/her itinerary, he/she must contact VX prior to departure to determine how this may affect the ticket and remaining travel. If a passenger does not show up for any reason for a flight noted on a ticket, VX may cancel his/her reservations and seat assignments on subsequent flight segments.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>3) &nbsp;If a passenger is holding duplicate reservations on a flight for the same time, date and name, reservations, including downline space, may be subject to cancellation. VX is not liable in the event that one or more of the duplicate reservations are cancelled.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>4) &nbsp;<u>Airport Check-In Time Limits</u>&nbsp;&ndash; VX has the right to cancel reservations of any passenger who fails to present himself/herself within the following time limits preceding posted departure time of applicable flights. Passengers must adhere to the following minimum times:</p>

	<p><u>NOTE</u>: The time limits provided by VX in this rule are minimum time requirements. Due to federal security screening measures in place at airports, passenger processing time may differ from airport to airport. It is the passenger&rsquo;s responsibility to ascertain the departure airport&rsquo;s time requirements for security screening so that they comply with VX minimum time limits.</p>

	<ol style="list-style-type:none">
		<li>
		<p>a) &nbsp;All passengers must be checked in at least forty (40) minutes prior to the departure for U.S. domestic flights and sixty (60) minutes for international flights.

		</li>
	</ol>
	</li>
	<li>5) VX is not liable when it cancels the reservation of any passenger in accordance with this rule, but if the reservation was cancelled pursuant to paragraph (1) above, Rule 80(B) (Flight Delays/Cancellations) will apply.&nbsp;</li>
</ol>

<p id="capacity-limitations"><strong>RULE 61&nbsp;<u>CAPACITY LIMITATIONS</u></strong></p>

<p>VX may limit the number of passengers carried on any one flight at fares governed by rules making reference hereto. Such fares will not necessarily be available on all flights.

<p id="tickets"><strong>RULE 65&nbsp;<u>TICKETS</u></strong></p>

<p>A)&nbsp;<u><strong>General</strong></u></p>

<ol style="list-style-type:none">

	</li>
	<li>

	<ol style="list-style-type:none">
		<li>
		<p>a) &nbsp;Use of coupons from two or more tickets issued at roundtrip fares for the purpose of circumventing applicable tariff rules is not permitted. VX and travel agents are prohibited from issuing tickets commonly referred to as &ldquo;Back-to- Back Ticketing&rdquo; under such circumstances when there is obvious intent to abuse and/or misuse restricted roundtrip fares.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
		<p>b) &nbsp;The purchase and use of roundtrip tickets for the purpose of one-way travel only, known as &ldquo;Throwaway Ticketing,&rdquo; is prohibited by VX.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
		<p>c) &nbsp;Fares apply for travel only between the points for which they are published. Tickets may not be purchased and used at fare(s) from an initial departure point on the ticket which is before the passenger&rsquo;s actual point of origin of travel or to a more distant point(s) than the passenger&rsquo;s actual destination being traveled, even when the purchase and use of such tickets would produce a lower fare. This practice is known as &ldquo;Hidden Cities Ticketing&rdquo; or &ldquo;Beyond Point Ticketing&rdquo; and is prohibited by VX.&nbsp;<u>NOTE</u>: For this instance, co-terminals are considered to be the same point.</p>
		</li>
	</ol>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>5) &nbsp;Prior to the start of travel, VX reserves the right to collect additional taxes and fees imposed by a government entity after a reservation is confirmed and paid.</p>
	</li>

Passengers who confirm a reservation with payment, or as allowable under Virgin America International Contract of Carriage 22 Posted 04/28/16 the &ldquo;24-hour hold policy&rdquo; section, are guaranteed that particular fare. In the event of a fare increase after the time of confirmation, the passenger may travel on the originally confirmed reservation without additional payment. If the fare decreases, a passenger may change their reservation to receive the new fare, however a change fee will apply.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>7)&nbsp;<u>Change Fees&nbsp;</u>&ndash; The chart below illustrates our change fees for flights on VX. The fees listed are in addition to any applicable fare difference between the original flight and the new flight at the same date or different date.

<p id="pets"><strong>RULE 105&nbsp;<u>ACCEPTANCES OF PETS AND ANIMALS</u></strong></p>

<p><u><strong>Pets in the Cabin</strong></u>&nbsp;&ndash; Virgin America gladly accepts small dogs, cats, household birds and domesticated rabbits as pets in the aircraft cabin on domestic flights. For international flights, only small dogs and cats may be allowed as pets. These pets must be carried in a pet carrier (kennel) that fits securely under the seat in front of the passenger. The kennel must have proper ventilation, a floor designed to absorb and retain solids or liquids, proper fabrication to prevent the escape of the pet(s) and prevent any part of the pet(s) from protruding, and plenty of room for the pet(s) to move freely. Soft-sided kennels are recommended in lieu of hard-sided kennels. The kennel must not be stored in front of an emergency exit row or bulkhead row. A maximum of five (5) pet carriers are allowed in the cabin per flight.</p>

<p>Pets cannot be accepted in First Class due to limited space under the seats. Pets cannot be accepted in Main Cabin Select due to the fact that this cabin exists in the bulkhead row and the exit row only, both of which preclude pets in kennels.</p>

<p>Hard sided carriers may not exceed17&rdquo;x11&rdquo;x7.5&rdquo; (length x width x height) and soft sided carriers may not exceed 17&rdquo;x11&rdquo;x9.5&rdquo; (length x width x height).
