<p>Infants will be accepted for travel after the seventh (7th) day of age. In the interest of safety, we encourage you to purchase a seat for your infant and have him or her sit in an approved child restraint system (e.g., an FAA approved car seat). An adult may carry an infant or child under the age of two (2) on his or her lap (a &ldquo;Lap Child&rdquo;). There is no charge for infants up to the age of two (2) not occupying a seat.</p>

<p>Children two (2) through four (4) years old must be accompanied by a Guest eighteen (18) years or older, and are required to occupy either an approved child restraint device (such as a FAA-approved car seat) or be comfortably restrained in an aircraft seat, using the provided seat belt. A seat must be purchased for a child who is at least two (2) years old at the time of travel, regardless of the child&rsquo;s age at the time the reservation was made or whether the child qualified as a Lap Child on the originating segment.</p>

<p id="unnacompanied-children-minors"><u>Unaccompanied Children (Minors)</u></p>

<p>The Unaccompanied Minor service is required on Virgin America for all children between the ages of 5-12 traveling without an adult 18 years or older. Virgin America will accept Unaccompanied Minors aged five (5) to seven (7) for non-stop itineraries only. Unaccompanied Minors aged eight (8) to twelve (12) may be accepted on connecting flights operated only by Virgin America. Unaccompanied Minor travel is not permitted on Interline or Codeshare connections.</p>

<p>Young adults thirteen (13) through seventeen (17) years old traveling unaccompanied are neither considered minors nor adults for travel purposes. However, if the parents or guardians wish the services provided to Unaccompanied Minors to be honored for their young adults we will do so.</p>

<p>The first flight in an unaccompanied minor&rsquo;s itinerary may not depart between 9:00 PM and 5:00 AM local time. A connecting flight may connect in that time frame unless it&rsquo;s the last flight of the day for that station. The only exception to this rule is when the flight or the connection flight is the only available flight of the day in that market.</p>

<p>The youngest child&rsquo;s flight restrictions will apply to all the other children flying together, including those not requesting UMNR service.</p>

<p>A charge will apply for Virgin America&rsquo;s Unaccompanied Minor service based on the length and destination of the flight. For the current fee please see our FAQs on the <a href="http://www.virginamerica.com" target="_blank">www.virginamerica.com</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p id="car-seats"><u>Car Seats</u></p>

<p>Virgin America allows the use of FAA-approved infant safety seats secured to standard Guest seats.</p>

<p>An infant safety seat cannot take up an aisle or exit row seat. It may not be located in the rows forward and behind emergency exit rows. Guests must ensure that infant safety seats used during flight remain secured at all times, even when unoccupied.</p>

<p>A window seat is the preferred location; however, other locations are acceptable provided that only persons responsible for the child occupy seats next to the child/infant.</p>

<p>Seats manufactured between January 1, 1981 and February 25, 1985 must bear the following label: &ldquo;This child restraint system conforms to all applicable federal motor vehicle safety standards.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Seats manufactured after February 26, 1985 must bear an additional label, printed in red, which reads: &ldquo;This restraint is certified for use in motor vehicles and aircraft.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Note: Booster-seats, vest and harness type child restraint systems, lap held child restraints, unlabeled seats and seats manufactured before January 1, 1981 are not acceptable.&nbsp;</p>

<p id="pregnant-women"><u>Pregnant Women</u></p>

<p>Virgin America will allow women to travel without a doctor&rsquo;s permission up to seven days before her due date. Any woman who is within seven days of her due date must submit a document from her physician on official letterhead stating that she is fit to fly. This information must be available to a Virgin America Team Member at check-in. If the Guest is traveling round trip, the document must indicate that she will be fit for the return portion of her trip as well.&nbsp;</p>

<p id="guests-with-disabilities"><u>Guests with Disabilities</u></p>

<p id="commitment-guests-with-disabilities"><u>Commitment to Guests with Disabilities</u><br />
Virgin America will strive to provide Guests who have disabilities with dignified, professional and courteous service at all times.</p>

<p id="service-animals"><u>Service animals</u><br />
Service animals may accompany a Guest with a disability on a flight. Any of the following evidence is acceptable as proof of an animal&rsquo;s service status.</p>

<ul>
	<li>An identification card for the animal;</li>
	<li>The presence of harness or markings on harnesses tags; or</li>
	<li>The Guest&#39;s credible verbal statement</li>
</ul>

<p>Guests with service animals will be seated so as not to obstruct another Guest&#39;s emergency exit path. A service animal will be put in close proximity to the Guest, such as underneath the seat in front of the Guest or held in the Guest&rsquo;s arms. However, no service animal may obstruct an aisle or an emergency exit path. Guests with service animals may not be seated in an emergency row.</p>

<p>Service animals must be trained to behave properly in public settings. An animal that engages in disruptive behavior such as running freely, barking, growling, urinating, biting or jumping on other Guests has not been successfully trained. In such cases, Virgin America is not required to treat the animal as a service animal, and may deny transportation of the animal in the cabin of the aircraft.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Service animals in training may be permitted onboard a domestic flight provided that they are being delivered to their permanent owner and accompanied by their trainer. Service dogs or puppies may also be allowed when their trainer brings them onboard with the intent to familiarize them with the aircraft and air travel. In both instances advanced notice for travel is required.</p>

<p>Guests traveling to Hawaii must have a health certificate dated within 14 days of the first travel date.</p>

<p id="portable-oxygen-concentrators"><u>Respiratory Assistive Devices</u><br />
Virgin America allows in-flight usage of certain carry-on Respiratory Assistive Devices that aid with an individual&rsquo;s respiratory functions. Ventilators, respirators and continuous positive airway pressure machines (CPAPs) may be used in all phases of flight, although prior notification is strongly advised. Portable oxygen concentrators (POCs) that are approved by the FAA maybe used in-flight. Guests wishing to use a Respiratory Assistive Device in-flight are strongly advised to call Virgin America with a minimum of 48 hours prior to the departure of their first scheduled flight. A POC without FAA approval may not be used in the cabin, but may be transported as an assistive device. Guests are responsible for bringing an adequate number of fully charged batteries to power the Respiratory Assistive Device for no less than 150% of the maximum flight duration as, unfortunately, Virgin America does not permit guests to use aircraft electrical outlets to use or charge these devices.</p>

<p>Ventilators and respirators are devices that breathe for someone who cannot breathe by themselves. The device supplies ambient air to the user.<br />
Continuous Positive Airway Pressure device (CPAP) is most commonly used to treat sleep apnea. The device provides ambient air that is delivered through a face mask. CPAPs do not contain or deliver pure oxygen.</p>

<p>A portable oxygen concentrator is a portable assistive medical device that takes ambient air, separates the oxygen from other gases, and provides the user with a concentrated level of oxygen.</p>

<p>Virgin America accepts the following FAA approved Portable Oxygen Concentrators (POCs):&nbsp;</p>

<p>At the airport, guests requiring the use of a POC in-flight will be required to present Virgin America&rsquo;s Portable Oxygen Concentrator Medical Authorization Form, which can be found in our FAQs on virginamerica.com, or a physician&rsquo;s statement with the following information:&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
	<li>Must have a physician&rsquo;s signature</li>
	<li>Notation which phases of flight (taxi, takeoff, cruise, landing etc.) oxygen use&nbsp;is medically necessary</li>
	<li>The physician&rsquo;s statement must be updated whenever your health changes&nbsp;in such a way that affects your fitness to fly with supplemental oxygen.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p>If a guest does not meet advance notice or check-in requirements consistent with&nbsp;this section, Virgin America will still provide the service or accommodation if&nbsp;reasonable efforts can be made, without delaying the flight.</p>

<p id="emotional-support-animals"><u>Emotional Support Animals</u><br />
Emotional support animals may accompany a Guest with a disability on a flight. Virgin America requires documentation to substantiate the Guest&#39;s disability-related need for the animal to accompany them in the aircraft cabin. Acceptable forms of documentation are listed below.</p>

<p>Guests may not travel with service animals that pose unavoidable safety and/or public health or safety concerns. Snakes, other reptiles, rodents and spiders fall within this category of animals.</p>

<p>Acceptable forms of documentation include a letter from a licensed mental health professional (e.g. psychiatrist, psychologist, licensed clinical social worker, including a medical doctor specifically treating the passenger&rsquo;s mental or emotional disability). The letter may not be more than one year old from the date of the guest&rsquo;s scheduled initial flight. It must include verification of all of the following information:</p>

<ul>
	<li>That the Guest has a mental health-related disability; and</li>
	<li>That having the animal accompany the Guest is necessary for the Guest&#39;s&nbsp;mental health, treatment, or to assist the Guest (with his or her disability); and</li>
	<li>That the individual providing the assessment of the Guest is a licensed mental health professional; and</li>
	<li>That the Guest is under the care of the individual providing the documentation. Guests traveling to Hawaii must have a health certificate dated within 14 days of the&nbsp;first travel date.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p id="wheelchairs"><u>Wheelchairs </u></p>

<ul>
	<li>One onboard wheelchair will be made available on board each aircraft at all&nbsp;times.</li>
	<li>Upon request, collapsible Guest wheelchairs will be accepted for up to two Guests and placed inside protective bags and stowed in the belly of the aircraft, on a first-come, first-served basis. (For wheelchairs that have batteries, see notes below.)</li>
	<li>All other wheelchairs that cannot be accommodated in the overhead storage bins will be transported as checked baggage.</li>
	<li>An assistive device such as a wheelchair will take precedence over other Guest baggage. In the event that other Guest baggage is unable to be transported in order to make room for assistive devices, Virgin America will transport such baggage on the next available flight to the Guest&rsquo;s destination.</li>
</ul>

<p><u>Battery-operated wheelchairs</u></p>

<ul style="list-style-type:none">
	<li>
	<p>Battery-operated wheelchairs/mobility aids are permitted on Virgin America aircraft, subject to size constraints of the cargo door. Wheelchairs/mobility aids&nbsp;will NOT be transported if it exhibits evidence of previous leakage or damage.&nbsp;</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><u>Batteries </u>- Batteries are classified as either &ldquo;spillable&rdquo; or &ldquo;non-spillable.&rdquo; As used below, Spillable batteries include those batteries that lack required &ldquo;non-spillable&rdquo; labeling by the manufacturer. Virgin America has a limited number of battery packaging units available at each ticket counter, which are available to Guests on first come, first served basis. All batteries must, upon visual inspection (including removal, if necessary, by a qualified Team Member), reveal no obvious defects. All batteries must meet applicable requirements of 49 CFR Part 173 for transport. In addition:&nbsp;</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><u>Non-Spillable Batteries</u></p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Non-Spillable Batteries must meet the provisions of 49 CFR &sect; 173.159 for non-spillable batteries and must be marked by the manufacturer as &ldquo;NONSPILLABLE.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

	<p>Batteries lacking non-spillable manufacturer labeling and spillable batteries that cannot remain in an upright position must be removed from the wheelchair/mobility aid. If necessary a qualified Team Member will be made available to assist the Guest in removing the battery. The battery must be transported in strong, rigid packaging under the following conditions:&nbsp;</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<ol>
	<li>
	<p>​The packaging must be leak-tight and impervious to battery fluid. An inner liner may be used to satisfy this requirement if there is absorbent material placed inside of the liner and the liner has a leak proof closure;&nbsp;</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>The battery must be protected against short circuits, secured upright in the packaging, and be packaged with enough compatible&nbsp;absorbent material to completely absorb liquid contents in the event or rupture of the battery; and&nbsp;</p>
	</li>
</ol>

<p>​The packaging must be labeled with a CORROSIVE label, marked to indicate proper orientation, and marked with the words &ldquo;Battery, wet, with wheelchair.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<p id="requiring-safety-assistants"><u>Guests requiring Safety Assistants</u></p>

<p>Virgin America may require a safety assistant for any guest if Virgin America determines that an attendant is essential for that person&rsquo;s safety. Virgin America will use the following criteria in assessing whether a Guest requires attendant safety assistant:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Is there a mental disability that makes the Guest unable to comprehend or respond appropriately to safety instructions including the safety briefing?</li>
	<li>Is there mobility impairment so severe that the Guest is unable to assist in his or her own evacuation of the aircraft?</li>
	<li>Is there a severe hearing or severe vision impairment such that the Guest cannot establish some means of communication with Team Members?</li>
</ul>

<p id="not-requiring-safety-assistants"><u>Guests not requiring Safety Assistants</u><br />
Virgin America will not require an assistant if all of the following conditions can be met:</p>

<ul>
	<li>The Guest has a method of communication sufficient to receive a safety briefing; and</li>
	<li>The Guest is able to assist in his or her own evacuation of the aircraft in the event of an emergency; and</li>
	<li>The Guest is able to comprehend and, if necessary, respond to safety instructions from Virgin America Team Members; and</li>
	<li>The Guest is able to travel to aircraft bathrooms on his or her own accord with only onboard wheelchair assistance from Team Members.</li>
</ul>

<p>If Virgin America determines that the Guest requires a safety assistant, but the Guest believes that she or he is capable of traveling without a safety assistant, Virgin America may require a safety assistant&ndash; either a Virgin America Team Member or other safety assistant selected by Virgin America, or a safety assistant selected by the Guest. In this situation, Virgin America will not charge for the transportation of the Guest&rsquo;s safety assistant.&nbsp;</p>

<p id="other-equipment"><u>Other Equipment</u><br />
Incubators and stretchers are not permitted in the aircraft for Guest use nor may they be carried on board, however, they may be used per the Guest&rsquo;s physician&rsquo;s direction prior to departure and upon arrival at either connecting or destination locations. The Guest, traveling companion, or attendant is responsible for setting up the incubators and stretchers when used during these periods.</p>

<p>The oxygen bottles on board are for use by the crew only in accordance with aircraft and medical emergencies.&nbsp;</p>

<p id="acaa-regulations"><u>ACAA Regulations</u></p>

<p>The U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) has issued regulations implementing The Air Carrier Access Act of 1986 (ACAA). These and other safety-related regulations address air travel by persons with disabilities and include provisions concerning the physical facilities and services to be provided to Guests with disabilities.</p>

<p>Virgin America makes every effort to comply with the DOT&rsquo;s rules. It is important to note, however, that FAA safety regulations take precedence over individual airline policies for carriage of Guests with disabilities.</p>

<p id="complaint-resolution"><u>Complaint Resolution</u><br />
If a person with a disability has a concern or complaint concerning their treatment on or by Virgin America, a Virgin America Complaint Resolution Official (CRO) is available to discuss such concerns with the Guest. At least one CRO will be made available at each airport served by Virgin America, either in person or by telephone.</p>

<p>To reach a CRO, contact a Virgin America airport supervisor through any Virgin America Team Member.&nbsp;</p>

<p id="allergies"><u>Allergies</u></p>

<p>Virgin America recognizes that some Guests are allergic to nuts, and that exposure to nuts can result in dire, or even fatal, consequences for Guests with the most severe allergies. Virgin America cannot guarantee an environment free of any allergies, including peanuts, peanut dust, peanut oil, or peanut remnants. Guests with severe allergies should advise Virgin America prior to travel.&nbsp;</p>

<p id="denied-boarding"><u>Denied Boarding</u></p>

<p>A Guest may be voluntarily or involuntarily denied boarding in the event of an oversold flight. Please see section on &ldquo;Denied Boarding Compensation&rdquo; in the Fares, Travel Bank and Refunds section of this document.&nbsp;</p>

<p id="denied-boarding-comp"><u>Denied Boarding Compensation</u></p>

<p><u>Overbooking</u></p>

<p>If at departure time more guests with confirmed reservations are present than there are seats available, Virgin America will first ask for volunteers who are willing to give up their seats in exchange for compensation and a confirmed seat on a later flight. On extremely rare occasions, a guest may be denied boarding on an involuntary basis, if a sufficient number of volunteers are not obtained. With few exceptions, persons denied boarding involuntarily are entitled to compensation under federal law.</p>

<p id="voluntary-denied-boarding"><u>Voluntary Denied Boarding</u><br />
In the event of an oversold flight, Virgin America will solicit volunteers for denied boarding compensation, and shall advise them if they are in danger of being involuntarily denied boarding and, if so, the compensation that Virgin America is obligated to pay if they are involuntarily denied boarding. Guests who are voluntarily denied boarding will be offered accommodation on a case-by-case basis, to be determined in the sole discretion of Virgin America Team Members staffing the flight. Accommodation may include, but is not limited to, rebooking on another flight (either on Virgin America or another airline) to the same or nearby destination, Travel Bank, hotel, or other accommodations.&nbsp;</p>

<p id="involuntary-denied-boarding"><u>Involuntary Denied Boarding</u></p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>When a flight is oversold and a sufficient number of volunteers has not been&nbsp;obtained, Virgin America will involuntarily deny boarding to one or more guests on the oversold flight according to the following boarding priority rules:&nbsp;​​​</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<ol>
	<li>
	<p>Guests with a confirmed reservation holding a seat assignment who check in and present themselves at the boarding gate in compliance with Virgin America&rsquo;s Check-In Requirements will be accommodated before guests with confirmed reservations who do not hold a seat assignment or do not present themselves at the boarding gate in compliance with Virgin America&rsquo;s Check-In Requirements.&nbsp;</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Guests with a confirmed reservation who do not hold a seat assignment but who check in and present themselves at the&nbsp;boarding gate in compliance with Virgin America&rsquo;s Check-In Requirements will be accommodated as follows:&nbsp;</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>o&nbsp;Guests who have been rebooked to the present flight as a result on an irregular operation of a previously booked flight</p>

	<p>o&nbsp;Elevate Gold guests</p>

	<p>o&nbsp;Elevate Silver guests&nbsp;</p>

	<p>o&nbsp;All other guests</p>

	<p>Within each of the foregoing groups, guests are prioritized first by class of service and then by time of check-in.</p>
	</li>
	<li>Special Needs Guests - because of the special needs of guests with disabilities, unaccompanied minors, aged or infirmed guests, and active members of the U.S. Armed Forces on travel orders, Virgin America reserves the right to accommodate these guests without regard to the boarding priority rules above.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
</ol>

<ul>
	<li>No compensation is due to guests who are involuntarily denied boarding&nbsp;and are rebooked on a flight planned to arrive within one (1) hour of their original planned arrival time&nbsp;</li>
	<li>
	<p>No compensation is due to guests who did not fully comply with Virgin America&rsquo;s reservation and check-in requirements, or cannot be accepted for transportation under the rules set forth in the Acceptance of Guests section.&nbsp;</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>No compensation is due where Virgin America offers accommodations, or seats the guest, in a section of the aircraft other than that specified on his/her ticket at no extra charge; provided however that if a guest is seated in a section for which a lower fare applies, the guest will be entitled to a refund of the difference in fare.&nbsp;</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Guests who are involuntarily denied boarding and are re-accommodated on alternate transportation planned to arrive more than one (1) hour but less than two (2) hours after their original planned arrival time will be paid 200% of the fare, including all mandatory taxes and fees, to the guest&rsquo;s next stopover, or if none, to his or her final destination, not to exceed $675.00. Guests who are involuntarily denied boarding and are re-accommodated on alternate transportation planned to arrive (2) hours or more after their original planned arrival time will be paid 400% of the value of the fare, including all mandatory taxes and fees, to the guest&rsquo;s next stopover, or if none, to his or her final destination, not to exceed $1,350.00. For purposes of applying the foregoing payment amounts in cases of a &ldquo;zero fare&rdquo; ticket (e.g., a ticket acquired without a substantial monetary payment such as by using frequent flyer miles or vouchers, or a consolidator ticket obtained after a monetary payment that does not show a fare amount on the ticket), the fare will be determined by the value of the lowest cash, check, or credit card payment charged for a ticket in the same class of service on the flight on which the guests intended to travel. A &ldquo;zero fare&rdquo; ticket does not include free or reduced rate air transportation provided to airline employees, their companions or similar such guests.&nbsp;</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>If all conditions for compensation are met, Virgin America will make any involuntary denied boarding payment on the day and at the place where the denial of boarding occurred, in cash or immediately negotiable check; provided, however, that if alternate transportation arranged for the passenger&rsquo;s convenience departs before the payment can be made to the passenger, then payment will be made by mail or other means within 24 hours after the denied boarding occurs. Guests may, at their option, elect to receive a Travel Bank in lieu of this cash or check payment, in which case the value of the Travel Bank shall be equal to or greater than the cash/check payment to which the guest would otherwise be entitled.&nbsp;</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p id="involuntary-travel-bank-refunds">​<u>Involuntary Refunds</u></p>

<p>In the event of Virgin America&#39;s refusal to transport (other than instances of voluntary denied boarding or involuntary denied boarding for which denied boarding compensation is provided) the following amounts will be offered to Guests for Travel Bank or refund (at the guest&rsquo;s option):</p>

<ul>
	<li>If the reservation is totally unused, the full amount as well as all ancillary fees will be credited to a Travel Bank or refunded (with no service charge or refund penalty); or</li>
	<li>If the reservation is partially used, the applicable fare for the unused segment/s and all unused ancillary fees will be credited to a Travel Bank or refunded.</li>
</ul>

<p>In the event of a flight cancellation, diversion, significant delay or a delay that will cause a guest to miss connections, Virgin America will, at the guest&rsquo;s request, provide a credit to Travel Bank or refund (at the guest&rsquo;s option), as described above.</p>

<p>In the event a guest who holds a confirmed reservation in First Class or Main Cabin Select and has complied with Virgin America&rsquo;s Check-In Requirements can only be accommodated in the Main Cabin, Virgin America will provide a credit to Travel Bank or refund (at the guest&rsquo;s option) equal to the fare differential.</p>

<p>Whether the refund is voluntary or involuntary, Virgin America reserves the right to refuse to make any refund in a currency other than the currency of purchase or in a country other than the country of purchase.&nbsp;</p>

<p><u>General Refund Policy</u></p>

<p>Regardless of the reason, it is Virgin America&rsquo;s policy to process all completed and approved refund requests within seven business days for payments made via credit card and within twenty days for payments made via cash or check.&nbsp;</p>
